This is my first HTML and css assignment for my Coding Temple Software Engineering course. In
this first assignment, I'll be showing my basic knowledge of creating web pages while using html elements like
forms, tables, navigation bars and images. This assignemnt will cover the first course of my course work.

This is also my first ever approach at front end design with html and css so bare with me and stay with me until the end of the course where I'll be using Python and Java 8
